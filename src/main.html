                <p>In the year 2014, I have completed my Bachelors of Electronics Engineering in
                    RMIT
                    University.

                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>Upon graduating from University, I have worked as a software engineer. As I have worked mainly with
                    embedded systems, I am relatively proficient in C and C++. I have also worked as a Electronics
